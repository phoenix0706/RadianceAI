# ðŸŒŸ Radiance AI

Welcome to **Radiance AI** â€” a personal repository documenting real-world implementations, concepts, and insights in Generative AI, Deep Learning, and intelligent agent-based systems.

This repo is a public space to:

- Share working code from my LinkedIn AI series
- Rebuild foundational concepts from scratch
- Explore modern GenAI workflows and tools (LangChain, LLMs, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Make AI practical, applicable, and open

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Repo?

AI content today is often abstract or over-simplified.

**Radiance AI** aims to cut the fluff and focus on:
- âœ… Working code + architecture sketches
- âœ… Clean visuals + intuitive explanations
- âœ… Real-world use cases mapped to practical AI systems
- âœ… Personal learnings from teaching 100+ students in AI/ML
